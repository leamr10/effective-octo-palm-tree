# Module 6 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create an application that pulls up the current weather and 5-day forecast from a weather API for a location typed into the search bar that is then saved in Local Storage. 

I was able to accomplish this by:
-Setting up the API/API key to run in the application
-Creating ID's and variables for each of the weather elements I wanted 
to display
-Creating functions for the different forecasts as well as the search bar/history

This task took me a bit to figure out how I wanted to approach it but once I found what worked for me, it wasn't too bad. It was a lot of repeating lines of code, just for the different parts of the forecast that I wanted to display on the page.
